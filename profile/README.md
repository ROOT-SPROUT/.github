# Hi, there This is RootSprout!

**A Coder’s Hub where reinventing the wheel and learning from scratch are prioritized.**

At RootSprout, we believe the best way to truly learn is to **start from the roots** — break things down to their fundamentals, and then **grow** them back up into fully working systems.  
No shortcuts. No black boxes. Just real understanding.  


## 📂 What You’ll Find Here
- Tutorials and guides that start from the **basics**.  
- Projects that grow from **low-level building blocks** into **complete systems**.  
- Open discussions and contributions from a community of curious builders.  


## 🌍 Get Involved
We welcome contributors who share our vision. Whether you’re:  
- Writing code 🖥️  
- Documenting processes 📝  
- Or simply experimenting 🔬  

…there’s a place for you here!  

Check out our repositories, open issues, and join us in building something from scratch.
